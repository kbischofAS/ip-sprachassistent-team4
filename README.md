# [Voice Assistant Sherlock](https://ip-team4.intia.de)
This is a Project to create Proof of Concept for a Voice Assistant. 
We are using these Tools:
- Wake word:  [Raven](https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy-wake-raven) ([Sherlock docs](https://ip-team4.intia.de/pages/knowledge/wake-word))
- Speech to Text: [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) ([Sherlock docs](https://ip-team4.intia.de/pages/knowledge/deepspeech))
- Intent Recognition: [Snips-NLU](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu) ([Sherlock docs](https://ip-team4.intia.de/pages/knowledge/intent-recognition))
- Intent Handling: [NodeRed](https://nodered.org/) ([Sherlock docs](https://ip-team4.intia.de/pages/knowledge/node-red))
- Text-To-Speech: [NanoTTS](https://github.com/gmn/nanotts) ([Sherlock docs](https://ip-team4.intia.de/pages/knowledge/tts/nano-tts))

## Documentation
The documentation is created in form of a GitHub page following the official documentation:  
[Sherlock docs](https://ip-team4.intia.de)
You can install Sherlock complete [automatically](https://ip-team4.intia.de/pages/installation/auto-install-script/auto-installation.html) 
or [manually](https://ip-team4.intia.de/pages/installation/manual/setup-software.html). Please follow the steps in the relevant section.

To run the documentation locally Jekyll is required. Follow the official installation [guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll for the appropriate OS. It is important to install the correct version to prevent potential problems with Github Pages. The officially supported version is listed [here](https://pages.github.com/versions/).  
The following command starts a local server, if Jekyll is installed with bundler:
```bash 
cd docs
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Troubleshooting
### Check service
If something doesn't run as expected, check if all services are running. To check the services run the command `sherlock-conf -c`:
```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sherlock-conf -c
Check services

Node-RED                          active (enabled)
Hermes LED Control                active (enabled)
Rhasspy                           active (enabled)
Rhasspy ASR Deepspeech Hermes     active (enabled)
Rhasspy Snips NLU Hermes          active (enabled)
zigbee2mqtt                       active (enabled)
```

### Restart services
Run the command `sherlock-conf -r` to restart all services:
```bash
Restarting...
...Node-RED
...Hermes LED Control
...Rhasspy ASR Deepspeech Hermes
...Rhasspy
...Rhasspy Snips NLU Hermes
...zigbee2mqtt
```
